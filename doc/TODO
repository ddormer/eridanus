    * Quote .like() special characters
    * Handle failures and tracebacks better.
    * Better IRC config/etc interfaces.
    * Handle named parameters to commands.
    * Update entry title if it was previously None and it gets pasted again.
      (This is probably going to require some hackery to getPage because there
      is no point trying to get the title of an image everytime it is pasted.)
    * Have the bot respond to private commands.
    * Optimise topContributors.
    * Implement a proper privs system.
    * Improve command handling (see ICommand from shs)
    * Switch to Mantissa. Plugin system.
    * Implement viewing network / channel / user entries
    * Store who an IRI is addressed to, if anyone.
    * Implement nickname tracking.
    * Allow "deferred" "telling".  So if I "tell Shrimp #1" and he's not around
      we will tell him as soon as he is.
    * Implement a more powerful EID addressing scheme: <eid>[.channel][.network]
      This will remove the need for an "entryChannel" parameter from commands.
    * The following codes should be retried, while any other error should
      stop retrying:
        408 Request Timeout
        500 Internal Server Error
        502 Bad Gateway
        503 Service Unavailable
        504 Gateway Timeout
    * Display any HTTP error that occured.
